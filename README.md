## Implementation Guide

### 1. Membership in one file
Create wp-content/plugins/bandfront-members/bandfront-members.php, add a GPL header, then on activation add a custom role and capability:

```php
register_activation_hook( __FILE__, function () {
	add_role(
		'backer',
		__( 'Backer', 'bandfront' ),
		[ 'read' => true, 'access_backstage' => true ]
	);
});
```

Gate protected pages by checking the capability in a wrapper template or a simple content filter:

```php
function bf_backstage_gate( $content ) {
	if ( get_post_meta( get_the_ID(), '_bf_backstage', true ) ) {
		if ( current_user_can( 'access_backstage' ) ) {
			return $content;                       // supporter sees full post
		}
		return '<p>This track is for backers only.
		        <a href="' . esc_url( home_url( '/join/' ) ) . '">Become a backer</a></p>';
	}
	return $content;
}
add_filter( 'the_content', 'bf_backstage_gate', 5 );
```

Add a tiny metabox that lets you tick "Backer-only" on any post, page or product; no big settings screen needed.

### 2. Taking the money
Because you already run WooCommerce, the lightest route is to sell one invisible product called "Backer subscription". When checkout completes, hook woocommerce_payment_complete and call bfas_assign_backer( $order ) to grant the role for a year (or until cancelled).

If you later want recurring billing, the official WooCommerce Subscriptions extension is GPL too, just not free; you can swap it in without touching the gating code.

### 3. Likes and chat on the same page
Turn on WordPress comments for your backstage posts and enqueue a 50-line JS file that replaces the standard "Reply" link with an inline üëç button. AJAX it to a custom REST route (/bf/v1/like/{post}) that stores a simple integer in post-meta, and print the running total next to the button. Only visitors who pass the same access_backstage capability check can hit the endpoint, so bots and lurkers stay out.
